# Monitoring-and-Alarm-System
This system will constantly monitor the temperature and humidity using an integrated temperature humidity sensor.
The temperature and humidity will be displayed and updated on an LCD screen.
This system will also include a clock module. If you don’t have the clock module, you can
also simulate one easily by using the delay function. It won’t be as accurate though.
The clock and the sensor data will be displayed together on the LCD
